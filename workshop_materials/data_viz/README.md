# Vesuvius dataset

Some Mt Vesuvius facts:
- Mt Vesuvius is a volcano in Southern Italy, in the outskirts of Naples.
- It's the only volcano to have erupted in mainland Europe in the last hundred years; its last eruption was in March 1944.
- In AD 79 there was a devastating eruption that destroyed Pompeii, described in 2 letters by Pliny the Younger. 
- Vesuvius is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanos in the world, because... 
  - it's the most densely populated volcanic region in the wold with 3 million people living nearby
  - it has a tendency toward violent, sudden explosions of the Plinian type, named for Pliny's description of Vesuvius
- Harvard connections: In the 1800s, there was a guestbook where people climbing Mt. Vesuvius could sign their names. One particular guestbook, active from 1826-1829, ended up in Houghton Library, where a historian transcribed quite a few lines from the guestbook by hand. This data has since been cleaned even further for easier visualization.
